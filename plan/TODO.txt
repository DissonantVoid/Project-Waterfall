ISSUES:
-we have clipping issues. when a character is inside the bucket and the bucket moves too fast
 the character can clip out of the bucket walls, this can be solved by adding 1 more layer of thickness to
 the bucket walls, this wall only collides with a specific layer that we give characters that are inside
 the bucket, in other words, once a character enters the bucket we can make it collide with the 2nd layer of
 the bucket wall which is much thiker
