A very secretive secret that is meant to be nothing but a secret
if you're seeing this secret and you are not meant to be seeing
this secret kindly consider unseeing this secret, you have been
secretly informed and you shall be secretly assasinated (it's a 
joke please Github don't ban me for harassment),
now if you're reading this secret it only means one thing and one
thing only, which is the very actual fact that you've ignored the
secretive secret to kindly unsee this secret or you're secretly
experimenting a potential sense of amusement as the dopamine in
your thick skull secretly seeps down your brainful brain which
in turn makes you (probably in secret) wants to secretly uncover
the secrets behind the secret that is this secret

of knowing something that nobody else knows is enough to make you want

by secret agents until you reveal all your secrets!
